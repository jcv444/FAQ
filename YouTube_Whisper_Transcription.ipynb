            " Hi, I'm Andrew and this is a quick tutorial on how to use opening eyes whisper model in Google Colab to make really high quality transcriptions and captions for your YouTube videos.\n",
            " We're starting off here on the GitHub page, which is what links to the Colab notebook.\n",
            " And if you're not familiar with Colab or Jupiter or Python notebooks, any other things I mentioned, don't worry, this will be a very easy tutorial and I'll explain what you need to know as we go along.\n",
            " So you can start off here by seeing this is a copy of the notebook, but we'll just click on that badge, which will take us to the actual notebook running on Google Colab.\n",
            " So what is Google Colab?\n",
            " It's a cloud service that lets you run a Python notebook.\n",
            " What's a Python notebook?\n",
            " A Python notebook is an environment where you can run both Python code and have text that explains what's going on.\n",
            " So I have a text block here describing the notebook.\n",
            " And below that, I have a code block.\n",
            " And when I click on that there, that will actually run the code and you can run each block step by step, which is really helpful for a lot of different kinds of applications and learning how to do things.\n",
            " Now, before running any code in this notebook, what you want to do is click on runtime and make sure that it's using a GPU.\n",
            " That would be a graphic processing unit.\n",
            " Why do we want to do this?\n",
            " Because GPUs work really, really well with a lot of machine learning tasks and it will make it much, much faster.\n",
            " So you can read this whenever you want, but I will walk you through the steps.\n",
            " Step number one is I'm going to click on this button here.\n",
            " It's going to give me a warning saying Google didn't write this.\n",
            " That's correct.\n",
            " I did.\n",
            " And it's going to run.\n",
            " So in the background, it's loading these different libraries.\n",
            " That's the code it's going to need to do what we're asking it to.\n",
            " In this case, YouTube DL, which will help us download the YouTube audio, then it'll have the opening eyes whisper framework.\n",
            " And then it's going to have a couple of things FFA impact in La Broso.\n",
            " And these are the import statements.\n",
            " This is what actually tells it to say, since we've loaded it, now make it available in the code.\n",
            " Now you notice we got a lot of output here.\n",
            " This is telling us each of the steps.\n",
            " Some of the stuff's already installed.\n",
            " Some of it had to be downloaded.\n",
            " Now we don't need to see that.\n",
            " So I can click on that button right there and it will hide it, but it's still there.\n",
            " Every time you run a cell or a block, you'll see a little green checkmark like the one here, since I already ran that one.\n",
            " So we've got the libraries downloaded.\n",
            " Now we need to select a model.\n",
            " So open eyes whisper model comes in five different sizes.\n",
            " And they are extremely capable, even the small ones, but the bigger ones are really useful if you want to translate into different languages.\n",
            " We're going to use the base model because it's really fast and it's high quality.\n",
            " But if you feel like you're not getting the results you want, then you can use a larger model.\n",
            " They will be slower, but more powerful.\n",
            " If you want to use it to translate a different language, then just delete the dot in there.\n",
            " But that's going to be a language we're using large does not have a dot in it's just a general purpose multi language model.\n",
            " So what we do here is we click that and it's going to load the model from the server here.\n",
            " And apparently it's already loaded.\n",
            " So we're good.\n",
            " You would see a little loading indicator if it needed to be loaded, but we're good to go.\n",
            " Next step.\n",
            " Well, next is the actual transcription.\n",
            " So you need a YouTube URL.\n",
            " So I'm going to use one from an old video of mine talking about some writing tip or something.\n",
            " And just click like that on play on run looks like a play button.\n",
            " And you get a little input box there.\n",
            " So I'm going to add my YouTube URL there.\n",
            " And we're going to click enter.\n",
            " And that's going to start the process.\n",
            " And you can see each step along the way.\n",
            " And you can see it running down here.\n",
            " The first thing it has to do, it actually has to load the video from YouTube, which it's doing in the background.\n",
            " And it's funny because it's actually kind of comically slow, even though it's all in the cloud, then it's going to extract the audio.\n",
            " So once it's got the video, it's going to run through a process and just strip out that audio that we can then use that with the model.\n",
            " So now that it has the audio, it says it's downloaded.\n",
            " If I click on this folder icon here, I can see that it has the mp3 file, which tells me that it's now doing the transcription, which it did in the time that it took me to explain that.\n",
            " So this video is over six minutes long to create this transcription.\n",
            " It took under four seconds.\n",
            " And that is by the look of it, a very accurate transcription.\n",
            " And if I go over here, I can click on text.\n",
            " And that will show me my transcription text, which looks good.\n",
            " Now to download this, I just click on the tab here and click download.\n",
            " And it will download for some reason.\n",
            " It can take a long time to upload or download files into Colab notebooks.\n",
            " But other than that, they're pretty awesome.\n",
            " So I now have my text file, which if I go to my YouTube page for that video, I can upload it and use something called auto sync, which will find the right places to start and stop the captions based upon the audio.\n",
            " There is a link here to click on if you want more information about that.\n",
            " But it will literally take you two minutes after you create this transcription to get it uploaded to your YouTube video and have it live, which is pretty awesome.\n",
            " For a comparison, I want to show you what my video looked like before with auto captioning.\n",
            " And then after after we've used the whisper base model to create captions for it.\n",
            " Imagine you're at a grocery store and you put some ice cream in your basket and some old lady grabs it and puts it her own.\n",
            " She does the same with your cereal, your beer, whatever, she keeps taking things from you and put it into her basket.\n",
            " It's kind of crazy.\n",
            " Now you go to a party and you tell your friend this and they're like, that's awesome.\n",
            " And they have you tell to somebody else in some.\n",
            " Imagine you're at a grocery store and you put some ice cream in your basket and some old lady grabs it and puts it her own.\n",
            " She does the same with your cereal, your beer, whatever, she keeps taking things from you and putting it into her basket.\n",

            " Now you go to a party and you tell your friend this and they're like, that's awesome.\n",
            " And they have you tell to somebody else.\n",
            " As you can see, the whisper version has punctuation and gets pretty much every word exactly.\n",
            " And it's a big improvement over auto captioning and took a very little time to do that.\n",
